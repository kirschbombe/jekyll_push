# JekyllPush
Jekyll gem plugin to push a compiled site to a GitHub branch. Works locally or on Travis CI if you add an access token.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jekyll_push'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll_push

## Usage

`$ jekyll push <branch_name>` or `$ bundle exec jekyll push <branch_name>`

## Configuration

If you run `jekyll push gh-pages` to use GitHub pages publishing, `JekyllPush` will look for a `repo_name` variable in your `_config.yml` file and try to construct a `baseurl` from it.

For example, if you have a repository named `my_site` and you add `repo_name: my_site` to your `_config.yml`, `JekyllPush` will rebuild your site with the `baseurl` `/my_site` before pushing. This lets you use `JekyllPush` for multiple branches and publish targets, with differing (base)url patterns.
